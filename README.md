# retail-sales-forecasting
< Simple data analysis on the retail sales data through 2014-2016 to gain better insights and predict the future sales. >
We have a dataset from daily retail sales in 2014 to 2016. For each record, we have the sale amount, the price, and the available stock.
The data is clean and there is no need to data wrangling.

Our aim is to: 
                1) Gain a better understanding from the data using exploratory data analysis.
                2) Train different models to predict the future sales.
